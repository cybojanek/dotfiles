# Configs

Various config files I use for my terminal and programs.

I did **NOT** by any means write all of this on my own. Its been collected over the years from many places on the web.

Thank you to everyone.

# Usage
Source any of the files you want in _bashrc/_, but _colors.sh_ should be first.

So far, some of it is only mac compatible (grc df, git completion etc...)
